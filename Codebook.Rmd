ActivityLabels -- was modified to "activity name" for the laying, sitting, etc.

Class -- variable used to identify the activity ID 

SubjectID -- used to identify the subject number for the experiments

All other variables that did not have complete names were renamed:

All variables that started with "t" were subsituted for "Time"
The same applies for "f" --> "Frequency"

The following 3 short names, were given full names:
"Acc", "Accelerometer"
